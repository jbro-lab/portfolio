The cryptic nature of medical procedure names posed a significant hurdle. But with the help of fellow BYU MISM students and ChatGPT, we found a solution. Using the gpt-3.5-turbo API, we automated the process of generating human-readable names and descriptions for complex medical procedures. The results were promising, as ChatGPT proved adept at transforming unintelligible names into layman-friendly terms. To whomever suggested we use ChatGPT to solve this problem: thank you!
